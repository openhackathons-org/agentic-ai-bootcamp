# Agentic AI Bootcamp
This bootcamp introduces developers to the foundations of building AI agents that can interact with external tools, data sources, and services. Participants will learn how to leverage **NVIDIA® NIM™** microservices for accelerated inference, implement the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardized AI-to-tool communication, and orchestrate agentic workflows using **LangGraph** followed by a Challenge.

## Bootcamp Content
This content contains 4 Labs, plus a challenge:

- Lab 1: Using NVIDIA NIM via Cloud and Local Endpoints

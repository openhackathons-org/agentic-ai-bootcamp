# Agentic AI Bootcamp
This bootcamp introduces developers to the foundations of building AI agents that can interact with external tools, data sources, and services. Participants will learn how to leverage **NVIDIA® NIM™** microservices for accelerated inference, implement the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardized AI-to-tool communication, and orchestrate agentic workflows using **LangGraph** followed by a Challenge.

## Bootcamp Content
This content contains 4 Labs, plus a challenge:

- Lab 1: Using NVIDIA NIM via Cloud and Local Endpoints
- Lab 2: Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Lab 3: Low-Level MCP Server Implementation
- Lab 4: Building Agentic Workflows with LangGraph
- Lab 5: Challenge

## Tools and Frameworks

The tools and frameworks used in this bootcamp are as follows

1. [NVIDIA NIM](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/index.html)
2. [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
3. [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)

## Bootcamp Duration

The duration of the tutorial is 2 hours.  
The duration of the challenge is 4 hours.

## Bootcamp Prerequisites

Basic experience with Python programming is required for this bootcamp. Familiarity with fundamental concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is recommended but not mandatory. Experience working with APIs (such as REST APIs) will be helpful. No prior experience with agentic AI frameworks is required.
